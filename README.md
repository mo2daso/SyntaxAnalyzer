# SyntaxAnalyzer
 
Overview:

The Syntax Analyzer (Parser) is a Python-based project designed to perform both lexical and syntactic analysis of programming code. It includes a graphical interface for ease of interaction and visual representation of parse trees. This tool is an excellent learning resource for understanding compiler construction concepts and syntax analysis.

Features
- Lexical Analysis:
Token recognition with detailed error handling and Token stream generation for parser input.

- Syntactic Analysis:
Grammar rules implemented using PLY's yacc module. Parse tree construction and syntax error reporting with references.

- Visualization:
Interactive parse tree visualization using networkx and matplotlib. Error highlighting and syntax feedback in real-time.

- User Interface:
Built with PyQt5 for a user-friendly experience. Integrated code editor with syntax highlighting.

- Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language.

PLY (Python Lex-Yacc): For lexical and syntactic analysis.

PyQt5: To create the graphical interface.

Networkx & Matplotlib: For parse tree visualization.
